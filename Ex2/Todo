Ideas:

Objects creation -->

Node_data >
simple node, representing:
constructor, copy const, compare, equals, string, and more methods like get set..

Edge_Data > consists of two nodes <src,dest>, representing:
constructor, copy const, compare, equals, string, and more methods like get set..

Geo_Location > is a vector location in terms of x,y,z ( actually its the node coordinates in space..)
constructor, copy const



DW_graph > has many Edges, nodes, etc : we will implement using HASH_MAP of nodes and edges.

DW_graph_algo > we will implement the algorithms by research and brainstorm,
using courses we took and with the help of google.
